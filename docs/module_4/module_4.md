# Module 4 - Day 1: Using F5 Application Services Templates (FAST)

From module 3 we have seen that using 'native' AS3 works but when more applications will get deployed through a declarative API, maintaining those can become a burden when the number of deployed apps reaches up to 100's to 1000's.

FAST provides an easy and effective way to deploy applications on the BIG-IP by leveraging AS3.

## About F5 Application Services Templates

The F5 Application Services Templates extension, or FAST, provides a way to streamline deployment of applications on BIG-IP using templatized AS3 declarations.

AS3 applications deployed through FAST can be managed using FAST. FAST auto-generates web forms custom to your templates for creating and modifying applications, and provides visibility into what FAST applications are configured on your BIG-IP.

The extension comes with a base set of templates for common use cases such as TCP or HTTPS. New templates can be created to satisfy specific needs of any infrastructure.

More information about FAST can be found on F5 Clouddocs: https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-templates/latest/

Note:
Module 4 covers the use of FAST and not the creation of custom templates with FAST.
