# Module 2 - Day 0: Provision BIG-IP into Cloud through Automation

This module is about explaining what got deployed through the use of Terraform into Azure.

What you will learn here is:
- Automation through Terraform
- Automated BIG-IP design deployment
- Exploring BIG-IP setup in Azure

For this workshop Terraform has been seledted as the tool to automate the environment. It is good to know that there are more ways to accomplish automated deployment of F5 BIG-IPs Virtual Editions.

An alternative way would be to use Cloud Solution Templates for Azure (https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-azure-arm-templates-v2), using Ansible or another REST API supported tool.
